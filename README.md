# foodsdataset
Working with JSON objects to output some nutritional infomation.
In this project, I imported a dataset file from "Corgis" website (with some more redundant ones removed) into an array (data.js).
I selected 7 datapoints that I thought were significant, and had them output to the screen. You can scroll through the whole file using the "previous" and "next" buttons.
In the section on the right, I researched the dataset to come up with a few interesting facts.
